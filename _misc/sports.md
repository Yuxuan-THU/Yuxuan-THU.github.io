Hi there! I am a junior undergrad majoring in History at Tsinghua University. My research interests encompass **Chinese politics** and **computational political science**. I have a particular inclination towards utilizing historical literature and empirical methods as my primary tools for understanding Chinese politics and society.

I have a passion for long-distance running and cycling, and I also open to other topics. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any intriguing ideas!

Check my [working paper](https://yuxuan-thu.github.io/files/workingpaper.pdf) and [CV](https://yuxuan-thu.github.io/files/cv.pdf) for more information.
