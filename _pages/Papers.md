**How can discursive mobilization be possible —— A study based People's Daily (with [Kaiping Zhang](https://www.dps.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1180/2342.htm))**

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
We establishes a dataset of 1,414 numerical abbreviations based on texts from the People's Daily. From a rhetorical style perspective, the most frequent types of numerical abbreviations are 'numeral-morpheme' type, four-character length, and with the final tone being a falling tone. From the perspective of mobilization effects, this paper also verifies the temporal correlation between the frequency of numerical abbreviations and political mobilization. Through a case study of the patriotic health campaign, this paper further refines the concept of the 'discourse championship' in political mobilization. First, the central government incentivizes local governments, using 'core discourse' in combination with 'extended discourse' to leverage systemic mobilization. Second, local governments align with the central government, using 'discourse intensification' along with 'discourse transformation' to promote social mobilization. This study expands the quantitative research approach in discourse analysis and political mobilization, providing policy insights for optimizing the party’s governing discourse system.
