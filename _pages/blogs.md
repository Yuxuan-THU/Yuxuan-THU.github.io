I would like to take some time to delve into introducing myself.

My name is Yuxuan Su, and I am currently enrolled in the undergraduate program of the Department of History at Tsinghua University. My academic interests span Chinese politics, computational political science, and historical political science. Originally from Xianyang City in Shaanxi Province, I enjoyed a fulfilling childhood there until I relocated to the provincial capital at the age of 12 to further my education. Despite having explored various regions, my attachment to northern China remains profound. I currently reside in Beijing, China.

Listed below are my areas of interest.

* **Academic research**

    I consider academic research as my **current** area of interest. While my research interests encompass a broad spectrum, I am particularly intrigued by authoritarian regimes and their diverse implementation methods. My overarching aim is to gain insight into contemporary China by delving into its historical context. For me, historical documents serve as crucial lenses through which to observe and analyze present-day China.

* **Computer Science**

    

Below, you'll find a list of things I'm somewhat interested in.

I maintain a respectful distance from the following things.

* chemistry and physics
* Chinese philosophy and foreign philosophy, foreign language and literature
* aesthetics, religious studies
* ideological education

    If you have intriguing findings in these areas, feel free to discuss them with me. Despite my lack of enthusiasm in these fields, I am more than willing to listen to substantive research results and share my thoughts. However, please refrain from discussing the **last item**.
