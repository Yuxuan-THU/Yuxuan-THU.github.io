Hi there! I am a senior undergrad majoring in History at Tsinghua University. My primary research interests lie in **Historical Political Economy (HPE)** , **Political Discourse** and **Chinese Politics**. 

I am dedicated to exploring elites's role in shaping state-building throughout history. My research focuses on two key questions: (1) the impact of elite social network structures on power-sharing mechanisms, and (2) the relationship between elite networks and the durability of revolutionary regimes. To this end, I am developing methodological tools for analyzing temporal dynamic networks and constructing elite social network datasets based on chronologies and other reliable materials.

In addition to HPE, I am also working on topics including the role of discourse in facilitating political mobilization. My scholarly exploration have appeared in academic conferences, including [13th Beijing Youth Political Science Forum](https://news.cupl.edu.cn/info/1012/40469.htm) and [7th Workshop on the Theory and Application of Historical Politics and Historical Institutionalism](https://www.cssn.cn/lsx/slcz/202404/t20240423_5747605.shtml). 

I have a passion for long-distance running and Fitness, I have participated in multiple half marathons and achieved 15th place (45 min and 25 s) in the 10,000-meter race at the 67th Tsinghua University Sports Meet. At the same time, I am also a public servant, serving as the Vice President of the [Student Science Association at Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/xtw/sdfg/xskxjsxhd.htm) and the President of the Zishan College Student Science Association at Tsinghua University.

I also open to other topics. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any intriguing ideas! You can reach me at su-yx21 [at] mails [dot] tsinghua [dot] edu [dot] cn.
