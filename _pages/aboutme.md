Before delving into the main topic, I would like to take some time to introduce myself.

My name is Yuxuan Su, and I am currently enrolled in the undergraduate program of the Department of History at Tsinghua University. I grew up in a small city in northwest China, where the compound of a state-owned factory "[**GuoMianYiChang**](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/%E8%A5%BF%E5%8C%97%E5%9B%BD%E6%A3%89%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%82/@34.3367961,108.7193162,19.44z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x3663838c19c60ead:0xa6294b6a3b9cb7b3!2z6KW_5YyX5Zu95qOJ5LiA5Y6C!8m2!3d34.337117!4d108.719767!16s%2Fg%2F1td5zywd!3m5!1s0x3663838c19c60ead:0xa6294b6a3b9cb7b3!8m2!3d34.337117!4d108.719767!16s%2Fg%2F1td5zywd?entry=ttu)" (a.k.a. 西北国棉一厂 in Chinese) in Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, held my childhood memories. After turning 12 I embarked on a journey to study in a different city, Xi'an became my second hometown as I completed my middle school and high school education there. Despite having explored various cities, my attachment to northern China remains profound. I currently reside in Beijing, China.

My interest in political science sparked during my first year of high school. At the age of 16, during a summer vacation, I immersed myself in [_**The Logic of Democracy**_](https://book.douban.com/subject/30203781/) (《民主的逻辑》in Chinese) by Bao Gangsheng. Following this enlightening read, during the autumn semester, I delved into [_**An Introduction to Political Science**_](https://book.douban.com/subject/26658395/) (《政治学通识》in Chinese) These two books significantly influenced and deepened my passion for the field of political science.

I have a particular inclination towards utilizing historical literature and empirical methods as my primary tools for understanding Chinese politics and society.

Listed below are my areas of interest.

* **Political Science**

    I consider academic research as my **current** area of interest. In my perspective, political science is captivating due to its amalgamation of deconstruction, storytelling, and scientific inquiry. While my research interests encompass a broad spectrum, I am particularly intrigued by authoritarian regimes and their diverse implementation methods. My overarching aim is to gain insight into contemporary China by delving into its historical context. For me, historical documents serve as crucial lenses through which to observe and analyze present-day China.

* **Computer Science**

    The remarkable advancements driven by technology often inspire a sense of wonder in people. I am eager to explore and discuss a wide range of topics, including artificial intelligence, programming languages, data visualization, and computer vision. My skillset includes foundational proficiency in programming with R and Python, document typesetting using LaTeX, version control with Git, and code hosting on GitHub. Despite these competencies, I maintain a humble and open-minded approach, always ready to further expand my knowledge.

* **Sports**
    
    I am deeply passionate about long-distance running, cycling and fitness, incorporating a consistent exercise regimen into my life has had profound benefits. Despite any limitations, I am determined to transition into a **dedicated runner**, aiming to integrate running into my lifestyle. Until June 2025, you can frequently find me at the East playground of Tsinghua University.



Below, you'll find a list of things I'm somewhat interested in.
* **Travel**
* **Econometrics**
* **Extreme sports**
* **Science fiction novels**

I maintain a respectful distance from the following things.

* **chemistry and physics**
* **Chinese philosophy and foreign philosophy**
* **aesthetics, religious studies**
* **ideological education**

    If you have intriguing findings in these areas, feel free to discuss them with me. Despite my lack of enthusiasm in these fields, I am more than willing to listen to substantive research results and share my thoughts. However, please refrain from discussing the **last item**.


Specifically, as a political science practitioner, I am willing to observe real-world politics and listen to **logical and traceable-evidence-based** interpretations and explanations of any political phenomena. 
However, I **refuse** to make personal judgments on ideological preference, and I **detest** people describing my research interest as "keyboard politics." (i.e. irresponsible and extremist comments on public issues made on the internet)

My blog writing will be based on my interests, and I welcome any friendly comments and discussions!
